# Information regarding the project

This project lists out the advisors in real time. I have created two endpoints to mock the data. First endpoint gets the initial advisors witht heir respective state/availibility and the second enpoint gets the same advisors with new state/availibility after 30 seconds.

This is a responsive application and I have used Bootstrap to achieve the same.

I have used redux for the state management of this application.

I have used [Typicode JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) to fake my data. My repo for fake data is [here](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mukulmkd/fakedata) Click on the two links namely [advisors](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mukulmkd/fakedata/advisors) and [availableadvisors](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mukulmkd/fakedata/availableadvisors) to see the api response.
